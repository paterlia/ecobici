This is the repository for the Ecobici project.

Ecobici is a bicycle-sharing system, also known as a public bicycle scheme, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Its operation started in 2010 intending to promote a healthy and environmentally friendly transportation and to encourage the use of an alternative method which reduces traffic congestion. 

In 2018 the Buenos Aires legislature approved the concession of the system for ten years to Teambici, a Brazilian private enterprise. In February 2019, Teambici began with the renovation of the bicycles and installation of new stations to distributing 4000 bicycles across 400 stations in 38 neighborhoods.

There are several complains about the hard work to find an available bicycle. So, I have started a project with the aim to understand the usage pattern of the system, to predict in a simple way the bicycle demand and to identify which stations should be upgraded or moved. The project will be divided into four parts:

- Part I: Data acquisition and data cleaning
- Part II: Exploratory data analysis
- Part III: Bicycle demand model
- Part IV: Station clusteirng and insights
